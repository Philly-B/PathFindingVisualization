## Build, Develop and Test
Regarding the build, development and testing, everything is straight forward like in a standard angular application. Since this application has been generated by the angular cli, the auto generated [readme file](./../PathFindingVisualizer/README.md) of angular describes the necessary steps of development.

## Deploy
The application can, additionally to the standard angular environment, deployed as a docker container. The Dockerfile in the root folder of the application can be used. To make it even simpler, docker-compose can be used to build and deploy at once. To build and deploy the application execute the following command in the root dir of the application
```
docker-compose up -d
```
